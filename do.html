      Indiegogo's crowdfunding campaigns are where new and groundbreaking
      products take flight, sometimes long before they hit mainstream
      availability. With thousands of campaigns launching every week, there's
      great tech, design, and much more around every corner — often with
      limited-time perks and pricing for the earliest backers. Before it's
      everywhere, it's on Indiegogo.
