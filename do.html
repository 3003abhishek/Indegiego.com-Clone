          With both live crowdfunding campaigns and innovative products shipping
          now, there’s no better place to start the hunt for cool and clever
          innovations that surprise and delight. Indiegogo is where
          <em>new</em> launches.

        Indiegogo's crowdfunding campaigns are where new and groundbreaking
        products take flight, sometimes long before they hit mainstream
        availability. With thousands of campaigns launching every week, there's
        great tech, design, and much more around every corner — often with
        limited-time perks and pricing for the earliest backers. Before it's
        everywhere, it's on Indiegogo.

        <h1>What is a perk?</h1>
        <p>
          Many campaigns offer perks to say thanks to backers, in exchange for
          different contribution amounts. Perks can be objects, acknowledgement,
          a thank you, services, events or anything that does not violate our
          Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perks are listed on the right side of the Campaign page, under the
          "Back It" button. If you do not see any perks listed, the campaign
          owner may have decided not to offer any perks.

            <p>
              With super-smart fitness technology squeezed into a sleek,
              take-it-anywhere design, the Misfit Shine was a huge hit. Today
              it’s available in stores everywhere, but Indiegogo backers were in
              on the action first.

            <p>
              This smash-hit campaign almost singlehandedly invented the smart
              suitcase as the must-have travel accessory that it is today. With
              innovative features like location tracking and a built-in scale,
              Bluesmart went big on Indiegogo before landing in stores around
              the world.

            <p>
              The Evapolar team’s slick air conditioner is small enough to place
              exactly where you need it most. It even cleans and humidifies as
              it cools. The campaign was so successful that the team came back
              to Indiegogo to launch the next-gen version.

              With its truly gigantic backer community, Super Troopers 2 became
              one of the most iconic Indiegogo film projects. The team behind
              the project offered backers everything from movie tickets to an
              actual police car from the film!
